# Clean-Health-Data

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This repository is dedicated to the process of **cleaning, merging, and preparing raw health-related datasets** for subsequent analysis or modeling. The core objective is to take disparate data sourcesâ€”user profiles, health metrics, supplement usage, and experiment resultsâ€”and transform them into a single, cohesive, and clean dataset (`merged_user_data.csv`).

The project uses a **Jupyter Notebook** to document and execute the entire data wrangling pipeline, ensuring reproducibility and clarity on all data cleaning and feature engineering steps.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To explore the data cleaning process or run the analysis yourself, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You will need **Python** installed on your system, along with the following libraries (likely including the data science staples):

* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for data visualization)

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
